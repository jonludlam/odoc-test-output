<h1>Module <code>Daemon</code></h1>
<p>This module provides support for daemonizing a process. It
provides flexibility as to where the standard file descriptors
(stdin, stdout and stderr) are connected after daemonization has
occurred.</p>

<p><code>daemonize</code> makes the executing process a daemon.</p>
<p>The optional arguments have defaults as per
<code>daemonize_wait</code>, below.</p>
<p>By default, output sent to stdout and stderr after daemonization
will be silently eaten. This behaviour may be adjusted by using
<code>redirect_stdout</code> and <code>redirect_stderr</code>. See
the documentation for <code>daemonize_wait</code> below.</p>

<dd>
<p><code>daemonize_wait</code> makes the executing process a
daemon, but delays full detachment from the calling shell/process
until the returned "release" closure is called.</p>
<p>Any output to stdout/stderr before the "release" closure is
called will get sent out normally. After "release" is called, stdin
is connected to /dev/null, and stdout and stderr are connected as
specified by <code>redirect_stdout</code> and
<code>redirect_stderr</code>. The default is the usual behavior
whereby both of these descriptors are connected to /dev/null.
<code>daemonize_wait</code>, however, will not redirect
stdout/stderr to /dev/null if they are already redirected to a
regular file by default, i.e., default redirection is
<code>`Dev_null_skip_regular_files</code>. This is to preserve
behavior from earlier versions.)</p>
<p>Note that calling <code>release</code> will adjust SIGPIPE
handling, so you should not rely on the delivery of this signal
during this time.</p>
<p><code>daemonize_wait</code> allows you to daemonize and then
start asynchronously, but still have stdout/stderr go to the
controlling terminal during startup. By default, when you
<code>daemonize</code>, toplevel exceptions during startup would
get sent to /dev/null. With <code>daemonize_wait</code>, toplevel
exceptions can go to the terminal until you call
<code>release</code>.</p>
<p>Forking (especially to daemonize) when running multiple threads
is tricky and generally a mistake. <code>daemonize</code> and
<code>daemonize_wait</code> check that the current number of
threads is not greater than expected. <code>daemonize_wait</code>
and <code>daemonize</code> also check that threads have not been
created, which is more conservative than the actual requirement
that multiple threads are not running. Using
<code>~allow_threads_to_have_been_created:true</code> bypasses that
check. This is useful if Async was previously running, and
therefore threads have been created, but has since been shut down.
On non-Linux platforms, using
<code>~allow_threads_to_have_been_created:true</code> eliminates
the protection <code>daemonize</code> and
<code>daemonize_wait</code> have regarding threads.</p>
<p>Raises <code>Failure</code> if forking was unsuccessful.</p>
